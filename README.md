# Airline_passenger
This is a step by step guide to a simple binary classification problem of predicting airline passenger satisfaction, this is a competition that I setup in Kaggle for a hackathon that I hosted, using the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction, there is both a beginner and intermediate notebook going step by step and explaining each step. 
The notebooks cover:
 - Importing datasets and libraries
 - Data cleaning
 - Feature engineering
 - Standardisation and normalisation
 - Statistical analysis - Chi-squared test
 - Statistical analysis - Multicollinearity
 - Exploratory data analysis
 - Label encoding
 - Model building and selection (Logistic regression, XGboost, Random forest, Decisison tree)
 - Model evaluation
